# Introduction

This page contains a collation of resources and exercises on interpretability. The focus is on [`TransformerLens`](https://github.com/neelnanda-io/TransformerLens), a library maintained by Neel Nanda.

The exercise are hosted on Streamlit, but there are also Colabs available. You can go to the Streamlit homepage [here](https://transformerlens-intro.streamlit.app/), which gives you instructions for how to run the Streamlit page locally (or links to the Colabs, if you prefer doing it that way).
